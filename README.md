# Doubly Linked List Library

A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called the previous pointer, together with the next pointer and data which are there in the singly linked list[[1]](#1).

## Installation

There is currently no installation as the project is in progress.

## Usage
This program can be used to sort and organize data from both ends of the created list. For example, if the user is inputting a random set of numbers in the order of [1,6,2,7,4,9], the program will take these inputs and sort them by adding the new input its respective position [1,2,4,6,7,9].
